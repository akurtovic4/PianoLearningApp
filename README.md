# PianoLearningApp

In this thesis, an application for learning the piano was developed using Swift User Interface, Reality Composer, and Apple's Augmented Reality framework. The goal of the application is to provide users with an interactive piano learning experience through a virtual keyboard and Musical Instrument Digital Interface file playback.

The application allows users to place a virtual keyboard on top of a physical keyboard using AR technology. Once the keyboard is set up, users can initiate the playback of their chosen MIDI file.

During the playback of the MIDI file, the application utilizes colors to highlight the corresponding notes on the virtual keyboard. These colors help users visually identify which keys to press while the melody is being played.
